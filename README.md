# Project 3: Spots - An Image Sharing Site

A website where individuals can edit their profiles, upload images & share their lives through their photos.

## Description Of Project

Spots is an interactive image sharing site where users can upload their own photos and edit their profiles for others to see. This application works well across Desktop, Tablet and Mobile views because it features adaptive web design, meaning that the content for this website will be displayed and function properly across most, if not all modern-day screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

Features and technologies used on this project include:

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS 3
- Flexbox
- Gridbox
- Positioning
- Adapative & Responsive Web Design via Media Queries in CSS to achieve equally good visuals & functionality of the website across Desktop, Tablet & Mobile views.
- Nested BEM file structure with BEM libraries for CSS files for each respective block of HTML code
- Image scaling & positioning
- Custom HTML Buttons that are styled with CSS, featuring Hover options like a color change on the button and pointer cursor when hovering over the button
- Hover statuses via pseudo classes in CSS

## Plan On Improving The Project

Some ideas I have for improving this project include:

- Adding drop shadows and glow to the cards add more visual flair to the cards list.
- Adding dvanced animation to each of the cards in the card list, so that when a user hovers over them with a cursor, it makes the card grow slightly bigger to show the photo more to users.
